Description: # Document Sorter
        
        Document Sorter is a Python package that automatically organizes documents into folders based on their content similarity. It supports various file types including PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, TXT, MD, and TEX.
        
        ## Features
        
        - Searches for documents in a specified directory
        - Extracts text from various file types
        - Clusters documents based on content similarity using the elbow method
        - Sorts documents into folders named after the most relevant keyword for each cluster
        - Supports dry run mode for testing
        - Provides verbose output option for detailed information during execution
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install Document Sorter using pip:
        
        ```
        pip install document-sorter
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        After installation, you can use the Document Sorter from the command line:
        
        ```
        document-sorter [directory_path] [--dry-run] [--verbose]
        ```
        
        - `directory_path`: The directory to search for documents (default: current directory)
        - `--dry-run`: Perform a dry run without moving files
        - `--verbose`: Print detailed information during execution
        
        ## Example
        
        ```
        document-sorter /path/to/documents --verbose
        ```
        
        This will sort all supported documents in the `/path/to/documents` directory and provide detailed output during the process.
        
        ## Requirements
